{"google":"UA-30910133-3","body":"SpreeAffiliateLinks\r\n===================\r\n\r\nI needed a way to give my Spree client a way to add footer affiliate\r\nimages with links, and so I created an extension for that. Simple.\r\n\r\nYou'll find an \"Affiliate Links\" section in the admin tabs. An example\r\non how to display the links in the layout is below.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n=======\r\n\r\nIt's not hard to use, but here's a seed to get you started:\r\n\r\n    # app/overrides/footer_affiliate_links.rb\r\n    Deface::Override.new(\r\n      :name => \"footer_affiliate_links\",\r\n      :virtual_path => \"spree/layouts/spree_application\",\r\n      :insert_bottom => \"#footer\",\r\n      :partial => \"affiliate_links/footer\"\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    # app/views/affiliate_links/_footer.html.erb\r\n    <%= Spree::AffiliateLink.each do |link| %>\r\n      <a href=\"<%= link.destination_url %>\">\r\n        <%= image_tag link.image.attachment.url(:small) %>\r\n      </a>\r\n    <% end %>\r\n\r\nThat'll get you all of the affiliate links in the footer. Currently,\r\nthere's no way to order them, and you'll have to add your own image size\r\nto the Spree::Image paperclip configuration dynamically if you want\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n-------\r\n\r\nBe sure to bundle your dependencies and then create a dummy test app for the specs to run against.\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n    $ bundle exec rake test_app\r\n    $ bundle exec rspec spec\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Sathya Sekaran, released under the New BSD License\r\n","tagline":"Affiliate links with paperclip images.","note":"Don't delete this file!
